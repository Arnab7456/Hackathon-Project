      An e-learning system should have the capacity to simulate the behavior of a human expert to identify the gap between the learnerâ€™s cognitive state and the learning objective with the intention of guiding the self-learner to take the initiative to bridge the gap with appropriate action and eventually achieve his learning objective

      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>Our prototype is basically an AI based advanced learning system. In current days learning is not only school or teacher depended. We are looking for a solution by creating an android and web-based application and implementing a system to enhance the quality of education. Basically, we are focusing on the school students and we are thinking of a tie-up with the school so that we can reach more students.</p>
